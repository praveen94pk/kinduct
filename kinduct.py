#Importing the neccessary libraries for our Kinduct assessment 

import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd


kinduct_data= pd.read_csv('/Users/praveen/kinduct/Book4.csv')

data= kinduct_data.drop(columns=["stint","PostGP","PostMin","PostW","PostL","PostT","PostENG","PostSHO","PostGA","PostSA"], axis = 1)
summation = data.groupby(['playerID']).sum()

player = data["playerID"]
total_players = len(player.unique().tolist())

teams = data["tmID"]
total_teams = len(teams.unique().tolist())

summation_team = kinduct_data.groupby(['tmID']).sum()

#Implementation
#1. Firstly, we are dropping the unwanted columns which are not useful for our current and future analysis. 
#2. The playersID got grouped by and summed up the numerical columns accordingly to support our upcoming analysis and finally stored in the summation pandas data frame.
#3. This greatly helps to answer our task 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. 


#Downloaded the data set from Kaggle and stored as CSV file format in the local system 
#and Reading the CSV file as Data Frame using pandas library. 

#Task 1: Displaying the Column tmID (Team ID) as strings 

#Implementation : Originally the tmID is in Pandas series and now it got converted in to string. The to_string function is used to 
#convert into strings accordingly. 

def task1_string_conversion(kinduct_data):
    print('Started Task 1')
    teamid= kinduct_data["tmID"].to_string
    return(teamid)
    print('Executed Task 1')
    
#Task 2: year to Year

    print('Started Task 2')
    year_change= kinduct_data.rename(columns={"year": "Year"})
    return(year_change)
    print('Executed Task 2')
    

#Implementation: The first letter of the year is in small letter and changed into capital letter by using rename function.

#Task 3: Wins_agg: total wins / total players
        
#Calculating the winning aggregation of the players. 

#Assumptions : Assuming the winning aggregation has to be calculated according to the players level. 
#To acheive this we are grouping the data according to the players played in the hockey matches respectively. 

def task3_wins_agg(summation, total_players):
    print('Started Task 3')
    Wins_agg = (summation["W"]/total_players)
    print('Executed Task 3')
    return round(Wins_agg, 2)
    
#Implementation: 

#1. To know the total number of players played we have applied unique function to avoid duplication and stored up in the list to count the number on players played in the hockey league. 
#2. Finally, to compute the aggregations we have calculated the total number of wins by a player and divided by the total number of players as mentioned. 

#Task 4: Losses_agg: total losses / total players
        
#Calculating the Losing Average of the Players. 

#Assumptions : Assuming the lossing aggregation has to be calculated according to the players level. 
#To acheive this we are grouping the data according to the players played in the hockey matches respectively.


def task4_losses_agg(summation, total_players):
    print('Started Task 4')
    Losses= summation["L"]
    Losses_agg = round((Losses/total_players),2)
    print('Executed Task 4')
    return round(Losses_agg, 2)
    

#Implementation:

#1. The summation data frame having all the summed up numerical columns grouped by the playerID. The column L in the data frame has the losses calculated according to the players 
#2. Computation done by dividing the total losses by total number of players played.

#Task 5: GP_agg: total games played / total players
        
#Assumptions : Assuming the games played aggregation has to be calculated according to the players level. 
#To acheive this we are grouping the data accordingly to the players played in the hockey matches respectively.

def task5_gp_agg(summation, total_players):
    print('Started Task 5')
    games_played = summation["GP"]
    games_played_agg = (games_played/total_players)
    print('Executed Task 5')
    return round(games_played_agg, 2)
    


#Implementation: 

#1. The summation data frame having all the summed up numerical columns grouped according to the playerID. The column GP in
#the data frame having the summation of games played.
#2. Games played divided by the total number of players gives us the aggregation of games played.
